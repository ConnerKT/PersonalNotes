1. Solidify your foundations: Continue to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as they are the building blocks of web development. Make sure you understand the basics, including variables, functions, loops, conditionals, data types, selectors, and styling.

2. Focus on data structures and algorithms: To be a good developer, it's essential to understand how to organize and manipulate data effectively. Study data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and algorithms like sorting, searching, and traversal. This knowledge will help you write efficient and optimized code.

3. Learn a popular framework: Once you have a strong foundation in the basics, it's time to delve into a popular web development framework. Some popular options include React, Angular, and Vue. These frameworks can help you develop more complex web applications, and learning one of them will make you more marketable as a developer.

4. Practice coding challenges: Participate in coding challenges such as those found on HackerRank, LeetCode, or CodeWars. These challenges will help you improve your problem-solving skills and become comfortable with coding under pressure.

5. Build projects: The best way to solidify your knowledge and skills is to build projects. Start with small projects that you can complete in a day or two, then work your way up to more complex projects that may take several weeks or months. Building projects will help you apply your knowledge in a practical way and develop a portfolio of work to showcase to potential employers.

6. Collaborate with other developers: Join online communities or attend meetups where you can collaborate with other developers. Collaborating with other developers can help you learn new techniques, gain valuable feedback, and build your network.

7. Keep learning: The tech industry is constantly evolving, so it's essential to keep learning. Stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends, attend conferences, take online courses, and read blogs and articles.

## Stretch Goals For Objects

1. Build a To-Do List Application

Create an array of objects to store each task's details (e.g. name, priority, due date)
Build a function that adds a new task to the array
Build a function that removes a task from the array
Build a function that sorts the tasks by priority or due date
Display the tasks in a table or list format on a webpage

2. Build a Weather Forecast Application

Use an API to fetch weather data for a specific location
Use an array to store the data for the next few days
Build a function that displays the data in a user-friendly format
Allow the user to search for different locations and display the weather data for those locations

3. Build a Quiz Application

Use an array of objects to store the quiz questions and answers
Build a function that selects a random question from the array and displays it on the webpage
Build a function that checks if the user's answer is correct and displays the result on the webpage
Keep track of the user's score and display it at the end of the quiz

4. Build a Recipe Application

Use an array of objects to store each recipe's details (e.g. name, ingredients, instructions)
Build a function that displays the recipe details in a user-friendly format
Allow the user to search for recipes by name or ingredient
Allow the user to add their own recipes to the array and display them on the webpage
